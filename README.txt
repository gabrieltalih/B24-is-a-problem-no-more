Make sure to import networkx, matplotlib, and scipy for there to be no missing modules.

Run one of the following files as the main for the following functionality:


PrintIntegerSolutions.py:

Writes an output text file that stores all solutions to the broadcast graph constraints.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

ProcessIntegerSolutions.py:

Reads this text file and attempts to generate graphs and test if they are broadcast graphs
with the different sets of values. Saves an output file of any graph found that passes
the broadcast algorithm.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

LoadSavedGraph.py:

Loads a saved graph and tests if it is a broadcast graph.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

BroadcastGraphs.py:

Tests different broadcasts graphs and displays the minimum broadcast spanning tree for
every eligible node of the different graphs.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

BroadcastTrees.py

Tests different broadcast trees from the source and displays the associated minimum
broadcast spanning tree for every passed tree.
